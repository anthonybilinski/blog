Good news for openSUSE users! Thanks to [sleep-walker](https://github.com/sleep-walker) qTox is now available in the official repository of openSUSE Tumbleweed. You can [see the package here](https://software.opensuse.org/package/qtox?search_term=qtox) or install it by using this command:
```
zypper install qtox
```

# Other distributions
We need packages for other GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu. If you would like to help us create them, please let us know on [our Github](https://github.com/qTox/qTox) or on IRC - #qtox on freenode.
