# First 2017 release!

qTox starts 2017 with small cleanup and modernisation release. We switched our
build system from `qmake` to `cmake` to get more flexibility and pave the way
for the first unit tests. As always, for details refer to the [changelog].

28 people contributed to this release. Kudos to them! :-)

# Plans

Since the qTox code base has grown organically over the years, we decide to
redesign some stuff from the ground up. People interested in software
architecture can find the current progress at [planning].

## Kudos
