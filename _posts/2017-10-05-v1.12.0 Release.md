# Great release great news

We again made this release cycle, mostly due to everybody being on holiday.
Thanks to many contributions this release is has some very nice new features
besides the usual bug fixes and refactoring.

# New features

Notable are the integration of the an EXIF library, to automatically
display images with correct orientation, a feature to mass import contacts
from a file and a new command line switch to open the login window instead of
a profile.

# Experimental echo cancelling

qTox received an experimental audio backend that provides echo cancelling
for when you're using qTox with the integrated mic and speaker of a laptop.
If the hardware/software combination supports it, there is a new checkbox
in the audio settings. Feedback on how it's working is highly appreciated!

# Build system

One of the first commits after this release has removed the `qTox.pro` file,
so for the main program qTox is exclusively using cmake now. Thanks to
`nurupo` we also have a pretty solid cross-compiling process for Windows now
and also a good looking Jenkins setup. On the Linux side there has been some
progress by `anthonybilinski` with setting up packages on the
OpenSUSE-Buildservice, which will hopefully bring back regular Linux packages.

# The usual stuff

Of course qTox also received the usual ton of fixes in this release cycle, the
details can be found in our [changelog].
