# Great release; great news

We again made this release cycle a bit longer, mostly due to everybody
being on holiday. Thanks to many contributions this release has some very
nice new features besides the usual bug fixes and refactoring.

# New features

Notable are:
- The integration of the an EXIF library, to automatically display images
  with correct orientation
- Mass import contacts from a file 
- A new command line switch to open the login window instead of
  a profile.

# Experimental echo cancelling

We integrated an experimental audio backend that provides echo cancelling
for when you're using qTox with the integrated mic and speaker of a laptop.
If the hardware/software combination supports it, there is a new checkbox
in the audio settings. Feedback on how it's working is highly appreciated!

# Build system

One of the first commits after this release has removed the `qTox.pro` file,
so for the main program qTox is exclusively using cmake now. Thanks to
[nurupo](https://github.com/nurupo) we now have a pretty solid
cross-compiling process for Windows and also a good looking Jenkins setup.
On the Linux side there has been some progress by 
[anthonybilinski](https://github.com/anthonybilinski) with setting up
packages on the OpenSUSE-Buildservice, which will hopefully bring back regular
Linux packages.

# The usual stuff

Of course qTox also received the usual ton of fixes in this release cycle, the
details can be found in our [changelog].
