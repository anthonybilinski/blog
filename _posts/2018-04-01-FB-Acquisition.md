We are happy to announce that qTox has entered a binding agreement with Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) to be acquired by the end of 2018. This acquisition will help qTox expand its user base and development velocity, as well as strengthening Facebookâ€™s devotion to privacy, transparency, and security.

The entire amount ($12.47 after taxes) will be split among 222 contributors, with each receiving an equal share. We are very happy that everyone is getting something out of this deal.

In an interview with the New York Times yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook said:

> Many people care about privacy, so to deflect from the ongoing [investigations](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43476594), we thought it would be a good idea to buy a security related project. This is great news to everyone interested in privacy. We will integrate qTox into qFacebookToxMessenger (QFTM) by 2020. Long live privacy!

Some of the new features that will come to qTox thanks to the heavy investment will be: mandatory photo identification of all users, overview of message content to prevent insulting or offensive messages, analysis of messages and friend graphs to help serve you the most relevant advertising and political messages.

More information about the future of qTox and QFTM will be released soon.
