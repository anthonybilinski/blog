# Delayed but better

Altough this release is delayed by one week, two handy new features made it
into qTox this release. First you can now mark messages with a tripple click
and second you can now automatically accept groupchat invites from select
contacts.

# New translations

Thanks to user `remussatala` who translated qTox to Romanian more users can now
enjoy qTox in their native language.

# Tons of fixes

Of course qTox also received the usual ton of fixes in this release cycle, the
details can be found in our [changelog].
